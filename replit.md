# EcoMart - Sustainable E-Commerce Platform

## Overview

EcoMart is a modern e-commerce platform focused on sustainable shopping, featuring real-time carbon tracking, smart budget management, and an innovative virtual garden system that rewards eco-friendly purchases. The application combines a React-based frontend with an Express.js backend, utilizing PostgreSQL for data persistence and Drizzle ORM for database management.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (@neondatabase/serverless)
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL store
- **API Design**: RESTful API architecture

## Key Components

### Database Schema
The application uses a comprehensive schema supporting:
- **Users**: Authentication, budget tracking, eco points, and garden progression
- **Products**: Sustainable product catalog with eco-ratings, carbon footprint data, and transparency information
- **Categories**: Product categorization system
- **Cart**: Shopping cart functionality with user-specific items
- **Recipes**: Recipe-based shopping integration
- **Eco Swaps**: Alternative product suggestions for sustainability
- **Notifications**: User notification system
- **Garden Progress**: Virtual garden progression tracking

### Frontend Components
- **Smart Cart**: Real-time cart management with budget tracking and eco suggestions
- **Product Cards**: Rich product displays with sustainability metrics and QR transparency codes
- **E-Garden Widget**: Gamified sustainability tracking interface
- **Notification System**: Toast-based user notifications for eco tips and budget alerts
- **Recipe Integration**: Recipe-to-shopping-list conversion functionality

### API Endpoints
- `/api/products` - Product catalog management with search and category filtering
- `/api/categories` - Product category management
- `/api/cart` - Shopping cart operations
- `/api/recipes` - Recipe management and ingredient mapping
- `/api/notifications` - User notification system
- `/api/user` - User profile and preferences management

## Data Flow

1. **User Authentication**: Users interact with the platform through a session-based authentication system
2. **Product Discovery**: Products are fetched with real-time filtering by category, search terms, and sustainability criteria
3. **Cart Management**: Items are added to user-specific carts with immediate budget and carbon footprint calculations
4. **Eco Tracking**: User actions are tracked to update eco points, garden level, and COâ‚‚ savings
5. **Recipe Integration**: Users can add entire recipe ingredient lists to their cart with one click
6. **Notification System**: Real-time notifications provide eco tips, budget alerts, and sustainability suggestions

## External Dependencies
